## 💾 DATA STRUCTURES

All data is currently stored in-memory (demo mode). Here are the data structures:

```javascript
// In-Memory Storage
const users = []              // All users (riders, drivers, admins)
const trips = []              // All trips
const vehicles = []           // Individual fleet vehicles
const vehicleTypes = []       // Vehicle categories
const pricingRules = []       // Pricing configurations
const zones = []              // Geo-fenced areas
const cities = []             // Service area cities
const promotions = []         // Promo codes
const walletTransactions = []  // Wallet credits/debits
const payouts = []            // Driver payouts
const referrals = []          // Referral tracking
const scheduledRides = []     // Future bookings
const emergencyAlerts = []    // SOS alerts
const supportTickets = []     // Support tickets with messages
const notifications = []      // Push notifications
const documents = []          // Driver KYC documents
```

3. Implement connection pooling
4. Add database migrations
5. Set up PostGIS for geospatial features

## 🎓 DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Code Patterns Used

#### Authentication Check
Every page includes:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('rideon_admin_token')
  if (!token) router.push('/login')
}, [])
```

#### Data Fetching Pattern
```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/admin/...')
    const data = await response.json()
    if (data.success) {
      // Handle data
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error)
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}
```

#### Modal Form Pattern
- State for `showModal`
- State for `formData`
- `handleSubmit` function for POST/PUT
- Reset form after submission
- Close modal on success

#### Table Display Pattern
- Map through data array
- Conditional rendering for empty state
- Color-coded status badges
- Action buttons (Edit, Delete, View)
