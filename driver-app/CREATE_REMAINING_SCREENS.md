# Remaining Screens to Create

The following screens are placeholders and need to be fully implemented:

## Main Screens
1. ✅ HomeScreen.js - CREATED (Complete with map, online toggle, trip request modal)
2. ✅ EarningsScreen.js - CREATED
3. ⏳ TripsScreen.js - Show trip history with filters
4. ⏳ ProfileScreen.js - Driver profile and settings
5. ⏳ RatingsScreen.js - View ratings and feedback
6. ⏳ ReferralScreen.js - Referral code and earnings

## Trip Screens
7. ⏳ TripDetailsScreen.js - Show current trip details
8. ⏳ NavigationScreen.js - Turn-by-turn navigation with Google Maps

## Profile Screens
9. ⏳ DocumentsScreen.js - Upload/manage documents
10. ⏳ VehicleScreen.js - Vehicle details and photos
11. ⏳ BankDetailsScreen.js - Bank account for payouts

## Support
12. ⏳ SupportScreen.js - FAQs, tickets, contact support

All screens should follow the same purple theme (#7C3AED) and use React Native Paper components for consistency.

## Next Steps After Screen Creation:
1. Create backend driver API endpoints
2. Implement Socket.IO for real-time trip requests
3. Add Google Maps API integration
4. Test on Android emulator
5. Build APK for deployment
